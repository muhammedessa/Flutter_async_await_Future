Async, await, and Future

Async = function is asynchronous and you  need to wait a bit to get its result.

Await = wait here until this function is finished and you will get its return value.

Future = returns value from your asynchronous function. It can complete with success(.then) or with
an error(.catchError).

.Then((value){…}) is a callback that’s called when future completes successfully(with a value).
